# Memory App MVP: Progress & Strategy Report

> [!NOTE]
> This document provides a comprehensive overview of our development journey up to the current state. It summarizes our core strategy, the process we adhered to, all completed milestones, and our immediate next steps toward achieving a premium user experience.

## 1. Our Process & Collaborative Strategy

Our execution strategy has been rooted in disciplined, document-driven development. Rather than rushing blindly into code, we established clear architectural and product goals upfront, serving as our "North Star".

*   **Product Definition First (`product.md`):** We strictly defined the project scope to focus on a local-first, privacy-respecting photo and emotional journaling experience. By explicitly listing "anti-goals" (no social features, no cloud sync, no AI prompt generation), we successfully prevented feature creep.
*   **Design as the Foundation (`design.md`):** As a Product Designer, ensuring a "warm, cozy, and handmade scrapbook" aesthetic was paramount. We defined our typographic choices (e.g., Playwrite Österreich), cohesive soft color palettes, and Apple-style "liquid glass" elevations before touching the UI layer.
*   **Structured Phased Execution (`task.md`):** The technical lifecycle was broken down into 9 distinct phases. We decoupled visual layouts from backend logic. For instance, we built the UI input forms before wiring up the local Room Database, allowing for early visual validation. 
*   **Rigorous Iteration & Polish:** Rather than calling the core features "done", we dedicated an entire phase (Phase 8) specifically for ensuring robust edge-case handling (unsaved changes dialogs, persistent photo storage, audio playback continuity, and absolute theme enforcement).

## 2. All That We've Done (Completed Milestones)

We have successfully completed **Phases 1 through 8**, fully realizing the functional requirements of the MVP.

### 🏗 Foundation & Architecture (Phases 1-2)
*   Initialized a clean Android Studio project using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.
*   Established a scalable directory structure (`ui`, `data`, `domain`).
*   Configured Jetpack Navigation Compose, bridging placeholder screens for the `DiaryScreen`, `CaptureScreen`, and `IndexScreen`.

### 🎨 The "Capture" & "Diary" Experience (Phases 3-5)
*   Built the primary input interfaces for composing text, attaching photos, and recording voice notes.
*   Integrated the **Room Database**, converting our `Memory` data models into persistent local SQLite tables.
*   Wrote Database Access Objects (DAOs) and successfully wired the UI interactions to save, read, and load records.
*   Implemented an efficient, infinitely scrolling `LazyColumn` for the main feed, designing dynamic Memory Cards that automatically adjust based on the content available (e.g., hiding image placeholders if no photo exists).

### 🚀 Advanced Capabilities (Phase 6)
*   **Rich Media Handling:** Successfully implemented gallery/camera photo selection mapping real device URI paths to our database.
*   **Audio Integration:** Connected the native `MediaRecorder` API to capture and securely save audio voice notes internally.
*   **Emotional UI:** Shipped a localized keyword-matching algorithm that reads the user's text on save, determines their "Emotional Tone", and assigns a representative color to the memory card.

### 🧹 Polish & Edge-Cases (Phases 7-8)
*   Finalized the "My Diaries" index view, allowing users to jump directly to specific dates.
*   Implemented complete Edit, Update, and Delete lifecycles for past memories.
*   Built a custom BackHandler dialog to warn users before discarding unsaved edits.
*   Refactored temporary URI media storage into persistent internal app storage to ensure images don't break over time.
*   Overrode default Material 3 tokens to strictly adhere to our custom `design.md` typography and soft-shadow aesthetics.

## 3. The Path Forward (Current Objective)

We are now officially entering **Phase 9: Premium UI**. The foundation is rock solid, and our strategy now shifts purely toward "Wow Factor" mechanics that elevate the app from standard to premium.

### Upcoming Tasks:
*   **The Instagram-Style Detail Screen:** Transitioning away from simple card tap-to-edit. Tapping a memory will now open a massive, immersive detail view where the photo or an animated mood-gradient occupies 70% of the screen.
*   **The Spotify-Style Audio Player:** Voice notes will no longer stop if you leave the screen. We are building a persistent, liquid-glass bottom bar player that follows the user globally until they dismiss it.

> [!TIP]
> **Developer Goal**
> As we dive into Phase 9, our strategy requires deliberate alignment. Before implementing the Spotify and Instagram-style view layouts, we will ensure all interactive gestures (swipe-to-dismiss vs. back buttons) and visual details (color pulses vs. parallax) are confirmed.
