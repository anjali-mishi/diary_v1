# Memory App MVP: Step-by-Step Task List

This is your roadmap to building the Memory App, designed specifically for you as a Product Designer to iterate on UI quickly while establishing a solid technical foundation. We will tackle these one step at a time.

## Phase 1: Environment & Project Foundation (Current)

- [x] **Task 1: Verify Installation.** Confirm Android Studio is installed and updated.
- [x] **Task 2: Verify Emulator.** Ensure your virtual device (e.g., Pixel 8) is running and accessible.
- [x] **Task 3: Initialize Project.** Create a new Android project:
    - Template: "Empty Activity" (This gives us a clean slate).
    - Language: Kotlin.
    - UI Toolkit: Jetpack Compose.
- [x] **Task 4: Understand Build Files.** Briefly review `build.gradle.kts` files to understand where we'll add external libraries later.
- [x] **Task 5: Initial Run.** Run the empty "Hello World" app on the emulator to confirm everything is connected.

## Phase 2: Core Architecture & Navigation Strategy

- [x] **Task 6: Define Folder Structure.** Set up the main folders (e.g., `ui`, `data`, `domain`) for organization.
- [x] **Task 7: Introduce Navigation.** Understand Jetpack Navigation Compose.
- [x] **Task 8: Create Placeholder Screens.** Build empty Composable functions for:
    - `DiaryScreen` (The main chronological view).
    - `CaptureScreen` (Where users add memories).
    - `IndexScreen` (The date-based jump list).
- [x] **Task 9: Wire Navigation.** Connect the placeholders so we can move between views.

## Phase 3: The "Capture" Experience (UI First)

- [x] **Task 10: Input UI.** Design the main text input area for the `CaptureScreen`.
- [x] **Task 11: Action Buttons.** Add placeholders for the Voice, Audio, and Photo action buttons.
- [x] **Task 12: Basic State Management.** Handle the temporary state of typed text holding it on the screen before saving.
- [x] **Task 13: Apply Aesthetics.** Apply initial color palettes, typography, and the "warm/cozy" visual style.

## Phase 4: Local Data Persistence (The Database)

- [x] **Task 14: Introduce Room.** Understand Room, our local database solution.
- [x] **Task 15: Create the Entity.** Translate the `Memory` data model from `product.md` into a Room Entity.
- [x] **Task 16: Define the DAO.** Create the Data Access Object (methods to insert, read, update, delete).
- [x] **Task 17: Connect Data to UI.** Wire up the "Save" button on the `CaptureScreen` to store the text in Room.

## Phase 5: The "Diary View" Experience

- [x] **Task 18: Build the List UI.** Use `LazyColumn` for an efficient scrolling list of memories.
- [x] **Task 19: Design the Memory Card.** Create the individual memory display component (text, media placeholders, emotional color).
- [x] **Task 20: Bind Data to List.** Connect the Room database to the list UI so new memories appear automatically.

## Phase 6: Advanced Capabilities (Iterating on MVP)

- [x] **Task 21: Handle Photo Storage.** Implement gallery/camera selection and saving the *path* to the database.
- [x] **Task 22: Audio Recording.** Integrate the MediaRecorder API to attach audio files.
  - *UI Refinement:* Consolidated bottom action bar from 3 buttons to 2. Mic button now handles recording (start/stop). Redundant PlayArrow record button removed.
- [x] **Task 23: Speech-to-Text.** Inline STT via `SpeechRecognizerManager` (`util/SpeechRecognizerManager.kt`). Mic icon in `CaptureScreen` toolbar starts listening; partial results stream live into the text field; final result appended on stop; error rolls back to pre-speech text. Runs alongside audio recording — separate permission path via `sttPending` flag.
- [x] **Task 24: Emotional Tone Detection.** Build the simple keyword matching logic to assign colors automatically.

## Phase 7: Polish and Remaining Navigation

- [x] **Task 25: Implement Index View.** Build the jump-list functionality for `IndexScreen`. UI label renamed to "My Diaries" per product.md.
- [x] **Task 26: Edit/Delete Logic.** Hook up long-press actions to modify existing entries.
- [x] **Task 27: Final Polish.** Review end-to-end flow and visual consistency against the product specifications.

## Phase 8: Bug Fixes & UX Polish

- [x] **Task 28: Audio Playback in Edit.** Use unique filenames for voice memos so they don't overwrite, and enable playback on the edit screen.
- [x] **Task 29: Persistent Photo Storage.** Copy selected photos to internal app storage rather than storing temporary URIs.
- [x] **Task 30: Unsaved Changes Dialog.** Intercept back/close actions to confirm discarding unsaved edits.
- [x] **Task 31: Absolute Theme Enforcement.** Map all Material 3 typography tokens to custom fonts and replace standard M3 elevations with custom soft shadows to perfectly match `design.md`.

## Phase 9: Capture Entry Point — Persistent Bottom Sheet

- [x] **Task 32: Replace FAB with Persistent Bottom Sheet.**
  - Removed the existing black `+` FAB button entirely.
  - Added a persistent bottom sheet occupying the bottom **15%** of the screen over `DiaryScreen`.
  - Sheet is always visible, never dismissible — primary entry point for creating a memory.

- [x] **Task 33: Bottom Sheet Collapsed State UI.**
  - The collapsed sheet displays:
    - Text prompt *"What's on your mind?"* left-aligned.
    - Mic icon and Photo icon grouped on the right, side by side.
  - Each zone has its own independent tap target (see Task 33a).

- [x] **Task 33a: Smart Sheet Tap Zones.**
  - Tapping the text prompt opens `CaptureScreen` with keyboard auto-focused.
  - Tapping the Mic icon opens `CaptureScreen` and immediately starts audio recording (or prompts for permission).
  - Tapping the Image icon opens `CaptureScreen` and immediately launches the photo picker.
  - Action is passed as a nav argument (`action=text|voice|image`) and handled via `LaunchedEffect` in `CaptureScreen`.

- [x] **Task 34: Bottom-to-Top Capture Screen Animation.**
  - `CaptureScreen` slides in from bottom to top (upward motion) covering 100% of the screen.
  - Use Compose `AnimatedVisibility` or `ModalBottomSheet` with a custom enter transition for the slide-up effect.

- [x] **Task 35: Soft Gradient Above the Sheet.**
  - Render a 30px tall gradient strip immediately above the sheet (between the diary list and the sheet edge).
  - Gradient colors: soft orange → pink, fully transparent at the top edge, opaque at the sheet edge.
  - This gradient does NOT blur the diary content — the 80% of screen above it remains 100% visible and unaffected.
  - Implement as a `Box` with `Brush.verticalGradient` overlaid at the bottom of the diary area.

> **CRITICAL RULE FOR ALL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:** Do not assume implementation details. If a dependency, UI layout, or technical approach is ambiguous, you MUST ask the user for clarity before executing code.

## Phase 10: CaptureScreen UI Enhancements

- [x] **Task 36: Screen Title.**
  - Add a title **"Add a memory"** at the top of `CaptureScreen`, below the close-button row and above the text input.
  - Typography: `MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium`, muted/secondary color so it doesn't compete with user input.
  - Reference: top bar area in `Screens.kt:492–524`.

- [x] **Task 37: Quick Starter Suggestion Chips (Empty State).**
  - When `textContent` is blank, show a horizontal scrollable row of pre-written prompt chips to help the user get started.
  - Chip examples: *"Today I felt…"*, *"Something I'm grateful for…"*, *"A moment I want to remember…"*, *"I was surprised by…"*
  - Tapping a chip inserts its text into `textContent` and hides the chip row.
  - Chip row disappears automatically once `textContent.isNotBlank()`.
  - Implement as a `LazyRow` of `SuggestionChip` (Material 3). No backend or ML — static list only.
  - **UI Update:** Chips are bottom-aligned, positioned directly above the mic/photo FAB row (i.e., right above the keypad), not below the title.
  - **Refinement:** Removed ellipses (`…`) from all starter chip labels. Tapping a chip now places the cursor at the end of the inserted text.

- [x] **Task 38: Inline Auto-Suggestions (Predictive Text Chips).**
  - As the user types, show 2–3 short predictive continuation chips in a strip **above the keyboard area** (between the text field and the mic/photo FABs).
  - Suggestions are **rule-based only** — no ML or external API:
    - Match the last few words of `textContent` against a small curated map of diary sentence starters → likely continuations.
    - Example: "Today I felt" → suggests *"happy"*, *"overwhelmed"*, *"at peace"*.
    - Example: "I want to remember" → suggests *"this moment"*, *"how it felt"*, *"every detail"*.
  - Tapping a chip appends the suggestion to `textContent`.
  - If no pattern matches, render an empty row (no visible strip).
  - Implement as a `Row` of `FilterChip` or plain styled `Text` buttons.
  - **Refinement:** Tapping a suggestion chip places the cursor at the end of the resulting text (not the beginning).

- [x] **Task 39: Waveform Audio Recording Visualizer.**
  - Replace the current "red dot + Recording Voice Memo…" text indicator (`Screens.kt:529–542`) with an animated waveform bar visualizer.
  - Waveform: a row of vertical bars that animate (height varies) while `isRecording == true`.
  - Bar heights: driven by `MediaRecorder.maxAmplitude` if wired in `AudioRecorder.kt`; otherwise simulated with random variation on a ~60ms timer using `LaunchedEffect`.
  - Bar colors: gradient from orange → pink, matching the sheet gradient from Task 35.
  - When recording stops, bars freeze briefly then fade out.
  - Implement using `Canvas` composable with `drawRect` for bars.
  - Does not change the audio preview row (play/stop) shown after recording ends.

- [x] **Task 40: Floating Bottom-Aligned "Save memory" CTA.**
  - Move the Save action from the top-right `TextButton` (`Screens.kt:506–520`) to a **full-width floating button at the bottom of the screen**.
  - Button design:
    - Full-width with 24dp horizontal padding.
    - Filled `Button` (Material 3 primary color) with label **"Save memory"**.
    - Soft apple-style shadow matching existing FAB shadows in the codebase.
    - Positioned above the mic/photo FAB row using a `Box` with `Alignment.BottomCenter` or `Scaffold` `bottomBar`.
  - Visibility: same conditional as current Save button — only shown when any content exists (`textContent.isNotBlank() || selectedPhotoUri != null || recordedAudioUri != null`).
  - Remove the existing `TextButton` Save from the top bar; replace its slot with `Spacer` so the Close button remains left-aligned.
  - Save logic in `CaptureViewModel.kt:36–78` remains unchanged.

- [x] **Task 41: Waveform Recording Visualizer — Bottom-Aligned & Thin Bars.**
  - Adjust the animated waveform from Task 39 so bars are **bottom-aligned** (grow upward from a fixed baseline) rather than center-aligned (current implementation grows from center).
  - Each bar must be exactly **4dp wide** (thin lines), with equal gaps between them.
  - Keep all other waveform behavior (amplitude polling, orange→pink gradient, fade-out on stop) unchanged.

  ### Task 41 Sub-tasks: Spotify-style Full-Screen Recording Mode

  - [x] **Task 41a: Full-Screen Recording Overlay — Hide Normal UI.**
    - When `isRecording == true`, replace the entire normal CaptureScreen layout with a dedicated full-screen recording view.
    - Elements to hide: title "Add a memory", text input field, suggestion chips (starters + predictive), photo FAB, save button, audio preview row.
    - The recording view is a `Column` split into two sections: top 60% and bottom 40%.

  - [x] **Task 41b: Recording Top Bar — "● Recording" Indicator + Timer.**
    - Top row: X button on the left (stops recording, saves audio), red dot + "Recording" text centered.
    - Below, vertically centered in the top 60% area: large bold elapsed timer in `M:SS` format (e.g. `0:04`), using `displayLarge` typography.
    - Timer tracks seconds since recording started via `System.currentTimeMillis()` polled in the existing amplitude `LaunchedEffect`.

  - [x] **Task 41c: Smooth Filled Wave Shape — Replace Thin Bars.**
    - Replace the current 4dp rectangular bar waveform with a smooth filled wave shape (Spotify-style).
    - Wave occupies the full height of the bottom 40% `Box`. Drawn with a `Canvas` using a `Path` with `cubicTo` bezier curves through 7 amplitude control points.
    - Wave top edge animates fluidly: each frame lerps current heights toward random targets at factor 0.18; targets refresh every ~5 frames (~500ms) for slow organic undulation. Poll interval: 100ms.
    - Fill: subtle app gradient `#FF9966 → #FF6699` at 15% alpha (`0x26` prefix).

  - [x] **Task 41d: Red Stop Button at Bottom Center.**
    - A large 64dp red (`#E53935`) circular FAB with X icon, centered at the bottom of the wave area with 32dp bottom padding.
    - "Stop" label (`bodySmall`) below the button.
    - Tapping calls `stopRecording()`, sets `isRecording = false`, returns to normal CaptureScreen with audio preview.

- [x] **Task 42: Save Audio as Waveform Data.**
  - While recording, continuously sample `AudioRecorder.maxAmplitude()` (100ms poll) and accumulate normalised amplitude values into a `mutableStateListOf<Float>()`.
  - When `stopRecording()` is called, the list is JSON-encoded as `"[f0,f1,…]"` and passed to `saveMemory()`.
  - Schema change: added `waveformData: String?` column to `Memory` entity; `AppDatabase` bumped to version 2 with `MIGRATION_1_2` (`ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN waveformData TEXT`).
  - `CaptureViewModel.saveMemory()` now accepts a `waveformData: String?` parameter and stores it on the `Memory` object.

- [x] **Task 43: Waveform Playback on Saved Audio.**
  - When a saved memory's audio is played, the stored waveform is decoded and rendered as 4dp vertical bars (orange→pink gradient, bottom-aligned) with a white playhead.
  - Playhead position is driven by `AudioPlayer.currentPosition / duration` polled at 100ms via `LaunchedEffect`; resets to 0 when playback stops or completes.
  - `AudioPlayer` exposes `currentPosition: Int` and `duration: Int` getters.
  - Implemented in both **DiaryScreen** memory card and **CaptureScreen** audio preview row.
  - Memories without `waveformData` (old entries) continue showing the existing "Voice Memo" text fallback.
  - Play/pause icon updated: shows `Pause` icon while playing instead of `Close`.

- [x] **Task 44: Bottom Sheet — Placeholder Alignment & Rounded Top Corners.**
  - Placeholder text *"What's on your mind?"* is **left-aligned** (text-start) and **vertically centered** within the sheet height using a `Box` with `contentAlignment = Alignment.CenterStart`.
  - Rounded top corners were already present (`RoundedCornerShape(topStart = 28.dp, topEnd = 28.dp)` via `.clip()`), so no shape change was needed.

- [x] **Task 45: Gradient as App Primary Color — "Save memory" Button & Global Update.**
  - Brand gradient `#FF9966 → #FF6699` (horizontal) applied as background fill via `Brush.horizontalGradient` + `containerColor = Transparent` on the "Save memory" `Button` (white text).
  - Same gradient applied to Mic FAB and Photo FAB (`CircleShape` background, transparent container, white icon).
  - Gradient strip (Task 35) and waveform bars (Task 39/41) already used matching values — confirmed, no change needed.
  - `design.md` already documented the canonical brand gradient — no change needed.

- [x] **Task 46: Memory Card — Remove Playwrite Font from Dates.**
  - Memory card date/timestamp changed from `Playwrite Österreich` to `MaterialTheme.typography.bodySmall` (the app's legible sans-serif).
  - No other card typography changes.

- [x] **Task 47: Replace Playwrite with Trocchi Font App-Wide.**
  - `trocchi_regular.ttf` added to `res/font/` (Google Fonts, OFL licensed — downloaded from google/fonts GitHub).
  - `playwriteFamily` → `trocchiFamily` in `Type.kt`; font file → `R.font.trocchi_regular`. All display/headline/titleLarge styles updated.
  - Inline `playwriteFamily` reference in `Screens.kt` (date group header in `IndexScreen`) updated to `trocchiFamily`.
  - `design.md` already documented Trocchi as Primary Font — no change needed.

- [x] **Task 48: Memory Entry Text — Center-Aligned in CaptureScreen.**
  - `textAlign = TextAlign.Center` added to `BasicTextField`'s `textStyle` in `CaptureScreen`.
  - Placeholder `"I remember..."` `Text` also receives `textAlign = Center` + `fillMaxWidth()` for visual consistency before the user starts typing.
  - No other screens affected.

- [x] **Task 49: Suggestion & Predictor Chips — White Fill with Soft Shadow.**
  - Both starter chips (Task 37) and predictor chips (Task 38) updated:
    - `containerColor = Color.White` via `SuggestionChipDefaults.suggestionChipColors`.
    - `border = null` — no outline.
    - `elevation = SuggestionChipDefaults.suggestionChipElevation(0.dp)` — M3 elevation zeroed.
    - `Modifier.appleShadow(4.dp)` — Apple-style soft diffuse shadow for depth.
  - Typography and tap behavior unchanged.

## Phase 13: Bento Grid Card Layout

### Grid Definition

```
Screen width = full bleed (e.g. 390dp on a standard device)
Columns      = 2
Column width = (screenWidth - horizontalPadding - gutter) / 2
               e.g. (390 - 16 - 8) / 2 ≈ 183dp per column
Gutter       = 8dp (between columns and between rows)
Outer margin = 8dp left + 8dp right

Span types:
  full  = 2 columns wide  (≈ 366dp)
  half  = 1 column wide   (≈ 183dp, square aspect ratio)
```

**Card type → span mapping (fixed, content-type driven):**

| Content type              | Condition                             | Span   | Approx size        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|
| Media card                | `photoUri != null`                    | full   | 366 × auto dp      |
| Audio card                | `audioUri != null && photoUri == null`| full   | 366 × auto dp      |
| Text-only card            | no photo, no audio                    | half   | 183 × 183 dp       |

**Internal stacking order (all card types):**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐  ← full-span card
│  MEDIA or AUDIO BLOCK   │  top: photo (180dp) or colour block (120dp)
├─────────────────────────┤
│  text  •  date  •  tag  │  bottom: content row (16dp padding)
└─────────────────────────┘

┌───────────┐              ← half-span card (text-only)
│ gradient  │
│ HEADLINE  │  bold first line
│ body…     │  remaining text
│ date • tag│
└───────────┘
```

- [x] **Task 50: Bento Grid Infrastructure — Variable Spans by Content Type.**
  - Replace the current list/grid layout in `IndexScreen` with a 2-column bento grid.
  - Use `LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid` (Compose) or a custom `LazyVerticalGrid` with `GridItemSpan` logic.
  - Span calculation: inspect each `MemoryEntity` — if `photoUri != null` → span 2; if `audioUri != null && photoUri == null` → span 2; text-only → span 1.
  - Grid gutters: `8.dp` horizontal, `8.dp` vertical, consistent with existing card padding.
  - Cards retain their existing `appleShadow`, corner radius, and white fill — only their grid slot changes.
  - No changes to `CaptureScreen` or data layer.

- [x] **Task 51: Media-First Card Layout — Photo on Top, Content Below.**
  - For cards where `photoUri != null`:
    - Top section: `AsyncImage` (Coil) fills the full card width at a fixed height of `180.dp`, `contentScale = Crop`, clipped to the card's top corners.
    - Bottom section: memory text (capped at 2 lines, ellipsized), date chip, and emotion tag sit below the image in a `Column` with `16.dp` padding.
  - If both photo and audio exist, photo takes the top slot; a small inline audio pill (mic icon + duration) appears inside the bottom content section.
  - No layout changes to text-only or audio-only cards in this task.

- [x] **Task 52: Audio-First Card Layout — Album-Art Block on Top, Content Below.**
  - For cards where `audioUri != null && photoUri == null`:
    - Top section: a solid colour block, `height = 120.dp`, full card width, using the memory's emotional tone colour (from `EmotionTone` palette). Centred inside: a circular white play/pause `IconButton` (`48.dp`) + audio duration label beneath it in `Caption` style.
    - Bottom section: memory text (capped at 2 lines), date chip, and emotion tag — same structure as Task 51's bottom section.
  - Tapping the play button triggers audio playback inline (reuse existing audio player logic); tapping anywhere else on the card opens the memory.
  - The colour block uses the same `EmotionTone` → `Color` mapping already established in the design system.

- [x] **Task 53: Text-Hero Card Layout — Full-Bleed Gradient with Bold Headline.**
  - For cards where `photoUri == null && audioUri == null`:
    - Card background: full-bleed `Brush.linearGradient` using the memory's emotional tone colour (light→slightly-darker tint, 2-stop), replacing the plain white fill.
    - First sentence/line of the memory text is extracted and rendered as a **headline** (`TitleMedium` or `HeadlineSmall`, bold, max 2 lines) at the top of the card.
    - Remaining text, if any, renders below in `BodySmall` (max 3 lines, ellipsized).
    - Date chip and emotion tag sit at the bottom of the card, tinted to contrast against the gradient (use `onSurface` or a darkened tone colour).
    - Card retains `appleShadow` and `1-col` square span from Task 50.

### Background Gradient Rule

- Always 3-stop vertical gradient: `[sentimentColor.copy(alpha=0.18f), sentimentColor.copy(alpha=0.06f), appBackground]`
- Occupies the full screen behind all content.
- `sentimentColor` = the `EmotionTone` → `Color` mapping already in the design system.

---

- [x] **Task 54: DetailScreen Scaffold + Navigation Wiring.**
  - Create `MemoryDetailScreen(memoryId: Long)` composable in a new file.
  - Register it as a destination in `NavHost` with route `"memory/{memoryId}"`.
  - In `IndexScreen`, replace the existing card `onClick` lambda with `navController.navigate("memory/${memory.id}")`.
  - Add a `CaptureScreen` navigation route for edit mode: `"capture/{memoryId}"` — reuses existing `CaptureScreen` but pre-populates fields from the given memory entity.
  - `MemoryDetailScreen` has a top app bar with a back arrow (left) and an edit `IconButton` (pencil icon, top-right); tapping edit navigates to `"capture/{memoryId}"`.
  - No UI chrome beyond the app bar in this task — content area left as a placeholder `Box`.

- [x] **Task 55: Card-to-Fullscreen Expand Transition.**
  - Wrap `NavHost` in `SharedTransitionLayout` (Compose `1.7+` shared-element API).
  - Apply `Modifier.sharedElement(...)` to the card container in `IndexScreen` and the root container in `MemoryDetailScreen`, keyed on `"card-${memory.id}"`.
  - Transition spec: `spring(stiffness = Spring.StiffnessMediumLow)` for bounds, `tween(300, easing = FastOutSlowInEasing)` for fade — approximates ease-in/ease-out feel.
  - If `SharedTransitionLayout` is unavailable for the project's Compose version, fall back to `AnimatedContent` with a `slideInVertically + fadeIn` / `slideOutVertically + fadeOut` pair using the same easing.
  - Ensure the card's corner radius animates from its resting value (`12.dp`) to `0.dp` as the card expands to fill the screen.

- [x] **Task 56: Parallax Media Hero (Photo & Audio Cards).**
  - In `MemoryDetailScreen`, implement a `NestedScrollConnection` that translates the hero image/block at **0.5× the scroll velocity** (parallax factor), clamped so the hero never scrolls fully off-screen until the content column reaches its natural top.
  - **Photo card:** `AsyncImage` (Coil), `fillMaxWidth`, initial height `300.dp`, `contentScale = Crop`. Clips to a `RoundedCornerShape(bottomStart = 16.dp, bottomEnd = 16.dp)`.
  - **Audio card:** Sentiment colour block, initial height `220.dp`, centred play/pause `IconButton` (`56.dp`) + duration label. Reuse audio player logic from Task 52. Block clips to same bottom-rounded shape.
  - Content column (text, date, emotion, audio pill) sits in a `LazyColumn` beneath the hero, with `16.dp` horizontal padding and `20.dp` top padding inside the first item.
  - Memory text is rendered **uncapped** (no `maxLines` limit) in `BodyLarge`.

- [x] **Task 57: Sentiment Gradient Background + Typography Hero (Text-Only Cards).**
  - **Background (all card types):** Draw a full-screen `Box` with `background(Brush.verticalGradient([sentimentColor.copy(0.18f), sentimentColor.copy(0.06f), appBackground]))` as the lowest layer behind the scroll content.
  - **Text-only hero:** No parallax block. Instead, render the full memory text in `DisplaySmall` (or `HeadlineLarge`) style using `TextStyle(brush = Brush.linearGradient(colors = listOf(Color.Black, sentimentColor), start = Offset(0f, 0f), end = Offset(0f, Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY)))` — black at the top, sentiment colour at the bottom.
  - Text sits in the upper portion of the screen with generous vertical padding (`top = 72.dp` to clear the app bar, `horizontal = 24.dp`).
  - Date chip and emotion tag appear below the text body with `top = 24.dp` spacing.
  - No parallax scroll connection needed for text-only; standard `LazyColumn` or `Column` with `verticalScroll`.

- [x] **Task 58: Swipe-Left on Card → CaptureScreen (Edit Mode).**
  - In `IndexScreen`, wrap each card with a `SwipeToDismiss` (or custom `Modifier.pointerInput` horizontal drag detector) that detects a leftward swipe exceeding a threshold of `72.dp`.
  - On confirmed left swipe: navigate to `"capture/${memory.id}"` (edit mode).
  - Visual feedback during swipe: reveal a tinted edit-icon background behind the card (sentiment colour at `alpha = 0.15f`) that scales in as the card slides left; snap back with spring animation if the threshold is not met.
  - Swipe-right on the same card: no action (guard against accidental triggers).

## Phase 14 Post-Polish: Detail Screen UX

- [x] **Task 58a: MemoryDetailScreen — Float Nav Buttons Restyled.**
  - Back and edit buttons changed from translucent dark circles (`Color.Black.copy(alpha=0.18f)`, white icon) to white circles with `appleShadow()` and near-black (`Color(0xFF1C1C1E)`) icon tint.
  - Consistent with the app's white-card + soft-shadow design language.

- [x] **Task 58b: MemoryDetailScreen — Text-Only Content Offset.**
  - Text-only `LazyColumn` now has `Modifier.statusBarsPadding().padding(top = 56.dp)` so body text starts below the floating nav buttons on all devices.

- [x] **Task 58c: MemoryDetailScreen — Shared Transition Close Fix.**
  - Replaced `spring(StiffnessMediumLow)` with `tween(500ms, FastOutSlowInEasing)` on `boundsTransform` for both card and detail `sharedBounds`.
  - Replaced asymmetric exit fades (card tween(300) / detail spring) with symmetric `fadeOut(tween(400))` on both sides.
  - Narrowed DiaryScreen `popEnterTransition` scope from 700ms → 600ms to prevent overlapping `AnimatedVisibilityScope` on repeat taps.
  - Added `popExitTransition = fadeOut(tween(400))` on the Detail nav route so the gradient background fades out smoothly instead of snapping on frame 1.

---

## Phase A-pre: Codebase Health

- [x] **Task 58d: Split Screens.kt into per-screen files.** ✅ DONE (May 2026, tag RTGL1.0)
  - `Screens.kt` split into:
    - `ui/DiaryScreen.kt` — DiaryScreen + BentoMemoryCard + bottom sheet
    - `ui/IndexScreen.kt` — IndexScreen + PolaroidPillCard + DotRailTimeline
    - `ui/CaptureScreen.kt` — CaptureScreen (capture + edit mode)
    - `ui/MemoryDetailScreen.kt` — already existed
    - `ui/Shared.kt` — shared helpers: appleShadow, emotionColor, shared composables
  - No behaviour changes. Build verified clean.

- [x] **Task 58e: CaptureScreen Edit Mode — Visual & UX Overhaul.** ✅ DONE (May 2026, tag RTGL1.0)
  - Two-layer background (gradient + scrim) matching MemoryDetailScreen.
  - Floating 68dp nav row with white-circle appleShadow buttons.
  - Content padding aligned to MemoryDetailScreen: 44dp body, 24dp controls.
  - 32dp spacer between nav row and first content block.
  - Emotion picker: white pill → ModalBottomSheet (6 options, checkmark on selected).
  - Save button: full-width gradient, bottom-pinned.
  - Crossfade transition (fadeIn/fadeOut 280ms) when navigating Detail ↔ Edit.
  - Auto-focus + keyboard open on edit mode entry.

- [x] **Task 58f: CaptureScreen Keyboard & Bottom Toolbar Polish.** ✅ DONE (May 2026)
  - `Modifier.imePadding()` on CaptureScreen Column — action row + Save button ride up with keyboard.
  - Keyboard auto-open fix: reactive `onFocusChanged` pattern replaces unreliable proactive `show()` at fixed delay.
  - Save button: full-width pill (`RoundedCornerShape(100dp)`, `fillMaxWidth`, `height(52dp)`, 16dp side margin).
  - Emotion tab moved into action icons row (left side), bare style (no pill/shadow), `ExpandMore` caret.
  - STT / mic removed entirely from CaptureScreen — `SpeechRecognizerManager`, all state, UI, and callbacks stripped.

---

## Phase A: Smarter Sentiment + Index Filters

### Goal
Replace keyword-based emotion detection with a free on-device/API model, and make the `IndexScreen` feel like a real diary with a timeline layout and filterable views.

- [ ] **Task 59: DB Migration 2→3 — Expanded Schema.** ⏸ DEFERRED — not needed for Android launch. Add when Phase B (bookmarks) is implemented.
  - Add `Migration(2, 3)` to `AppDatabase.kt` with the following `ALTER TABLE` statements on the `memories` table:
    - `emotionIntensity REAL` — 0.0–1.0 confidence score from the sentiment model.
    - `secondaryEmotionalTone TEXT` — second-highest emotion label (nullable).
    - `isBookmarked INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — boolean flag.
    - `bookmarkedAt INTEGER` — epoch ms timestamp, nullable.
    - `stickers TEXT` — JSON-encoded `List<String>` of sticker codes, nullable.
    - `entryType TEXT` — `"MEMORY"` (default) or `"LETTER"`.
    - `sealedUntil INTEGER` — epoch ms, nullable. Letters only.
    - `isRevealed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — boolean. Letters only.
  - Bump `AppDatabase` version from `2` to `3`. Add new fields to `Memory` entity with `@ColumnInfo` defaults matching the migration.
  - Update `MemoryDao` and `MemoryRepository` with any new query methods needed downstream.

- [ ] **Task 60 (REVISED): Indian English Keyword Enrichment — Emotion Detection.**
  - ~~HuggingFace API approach dropped.~~ Reasons: 30s cold start UX issue, $0.10/month free tier limit, not trained on Indian English/Hinglish, external API dependency.
  - **New approach:** Enrich `EmotionDetector.kt` keyword sets with Indian English, Hinglish transliterations, Gen Z slang, and spiritual/cultural language.
  - **Research phase (user):** Use the provided research brief to gather keywords from Reddit India, Twitter, Quora India, Instagram, YouTube UGC. Deliver structured keyword doc per emotion.
  - **Implementation phase (Claude):** Expand `setOf(...)` blocks in `EmotionDetector.kt`. No new files, no dependencies, no API keys.
  - **Validation:** Run detector against 10 test phrases (provided in research brief) and show predicted output before writing to file.
  - **CALM gap:** HuggingFace has no `calm` label — keyword detection preserves CALM correctly. Enrich calm keywords with: shanti, grounded, shukar, prasad, slow day, me time, chai time.
  - No changes to `CaptureViewModel` — `EmotionDetector.detect()` call is unchanged.

- [x] **Task 61 (superseded): IndexScreen — Sentiment Dial + PolaroidPillCard List.**
  - Replaced the planned `LazyColumn` timeline layout with a fully custom sentiment-driven browser:
  - **DialKnob** (`ui/DialKnob.kt`): skeuomorphic Canvas-drawn radio dial, 6 snap positions (Happy/Calm/Excited/Anxious/Sad/Neutral). Sentiment carousel inside center pill, clipped to pill bounds. Dial value hoisted to `DiaryViewModel.indexDialValue` for cross-navigation persistence.
  - **PolaroidPillCard**: 82dp row — 58×68dp polaroid thumbnail (2dp radius, `appleShadow`) with fixed decorative tilt + text column (snippet 16sp nunitoFamily Regular + date `labelSmall #8E8A86`). Equal visual weight for all cards. Fallback: date-as-art in Trocchi Bold on 25% washed emotion color.
  - **DotRailTimeline**: Canvas dot-rail scrubber always visible; shows empty rail (no dots) when 0 memories match sentiment.
  - **Sentiment gradient**: full-screen top-bleed using `graphicsLayer { translationY = -topBleedPx }`.
  - **Shuffle button**: brand gradient circle, always `TopEnd` pinned.

- [x] **Task 62 (superseded): Emotion Filter Chips → replaced by DialKnob.**
  - Sentiment selection is handled by the DialKnob (6 sentiments). No chip row needed.

---

## Phase: IndexScreen Final Polish (2026-05-08)

### Goal
Align IndexScreen visual language with MemoryDetailScreen and CaptureScreen. Implement two-layer backgrounds, updated navigation, redesigned memory rows, and dial refinements.

- [x] **Task 63: IndexScreen Two-Layer Background & Header Redesign**
  - Applied standardised two-layer background: emotion gradient (appBackground → emotionColor.copy(0.18f)) + memory_detail_scrim image
  - Redesigned header: floating Row with back button + "My Diaries" title (left), Plus button (right)
  - statusBarsPadding + padding layout (no fixed height) matching MemoryDetailScreen pattern
  - Plus button navigates to `CaptureScreen?action=text`

- [x] **Task 64: PolaroidPillCard Redesign**
  - Restructured layout: text column on left, 58×68dp polaroid on right (when photoUri exists)
  - Hidden polaroid when no media present (previously always rendered)
  - Row height: 82dp → 68dp
  - Added HorizontalDivider (0.5dp, transparent) below each card for list separation
  - Divider padding: 16dp horizontal

- [x] **Task 65: Shuffle Button Redesign**
  - Secondary button style: white background, black text, primary-color icon (#FF9966)
  - Positioned TopEnd on bottom container (above dial knob area)
  - RoundedCornerShape(20dp), appleShadow for consistent elevation

- [x] **Task 66: DialKnob Hue Shift & Typography**
  - Implemented hue-only shift (not saturation/brightness) from emotion color
  - Added `Color.hue()` and `Color.withHue(hue)` helpers using `android.graphics.Color` RGB↔HSV conversion
  - Applied emotion hue to: rimAccent, mutedFg, neuDark, metallic rim gradient
  - Font changed: Trocchi → Nunito (app default)

- [x] **Task 67: Fade Gradient Alpha**
  - Reduced from undefined (full opacity) to 20% alpha
  - Prevents fade gradient from hiding emotion gradient and scrim, provides subtle list-to-dial separation

- [x] **Task 68: Spacing Compaction**
  - Bottom container: 280dp → 210dp
  - List bottom padding: 280dp → 210dp
  - Dial: padding(top=44dp), height=140dp
  - List contentPadding: top=4dp, bottom=16dp, spacedBy=0dp
  - Removes dead space between list and dial area

---

## Phase: Memory Detail — Audio Variant UX (Pre-Launch Polish)

### Goal
Lock down playback, pause/resume, deletion, and edge cases for the audio variant of `MemoryDetailScreen` before Android launch.

### UX Spec — Locked Decisions

**Playback states (4):**
- IDLE → PLAYING → PAUSED → COMPLETED → IDLE
- Tap hero or pill (IDLE) = play from 0
- Tap (PLAYING) = pause, retain position
- Tap (PAUSED) = resume from saved position
- Reaches end = auto-stop, reset to IDLE
- **Position is session-scoped:** retained while screen is alive; resets to 0 when user navigates away and returns

**Surfaces:**
- Audio-only memory → show **hero only** (pill hidden)
- Photo + audio memory → show pill below text (hero is photo)

**Audio focus / interruptions:**
- Pause on phone call, app backgrounding, or another app starting media playback
- Use Android `AudioFocusRequest` API

**Delete:**
- Independent **Delete Audio** button on `MemoryDetailScreen` (audio-only or audio+photo memories)
- Tap → confirmation dialog ("Delete this audio? Memory text will be kept.")
- On confirm: delete audio file + clear `audioFilePath` and `waveformData` in DB
- Memory becomes text-only variant (or photo-only if photo present)
- Stops playback if currently playing

### Tasks

- [x] **Task A1: AudioPlayer pause/resume support.** ✅ COMPLETE
  - Added `pause()` (saves position, doesn't release) and `resume()` (continues from saved position) to `util/AudioPlayer.kt`.
  - Kept `stop()` and `release()` unchanged (full release).
  - Pause retains `MediaPlayer` instance; resume calls `start()`.

- [x] **Task A2: MemoryDetailScreen — pause/resume wiring.** ✅ COMPLETE
  - Implemented AudioState enum (IDLE, PLAYING, PAUSED) for 3-state management.
  - Hero and pill toggle between pause/resume using AudioState instead of boolean.
  - Position retained within session; DisposableEffect releases on navigate away (next visit starts at 0).

- [x] **Task A3: Hide pill when hero is showing audio.** ✅ COMPLETE
  - AudioPill renders only when `memory.audioFilePath != null && memory.photoFilePath != null`.
  - Audio-only memories: hero waveform is sole audio surface.

- [x] **Task A4: Audio focus integration.** ✅ COMPLETE
  - Implemented AudioFocusRequest in AudioPlayer with OnAudioFocusChangeListener.
  - AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT / LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK → auto-pause.
  - AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN → resume if was playing before loss.
  - AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS (permanent) → stop + release.

- [x] **Task A5: Delete audio button + confirmation.** ✅ COMPLETE (Refined)
  - **Removed from audio hero** per design revision (user feedback on mockup).
  - Would have been standalone row, but delete functionality deferred to future implementation.
  - Audio-only memories focus on playback UX without delete on hero surface.

### Additional Fixes (Session 2026-05-07)

- [x] **Keyboard Auto-Focus on Edit (CaptureScreen).** ✅ COMPLETE
  - Fixed: LaunchedEffect now handles null action case (editing existing memory).
  - Keyboard auto-opens after 400ms crossfade delay, matching new-memory behavior.

- [x] **Scroll Position Retention on Back-Navigation (DiaryScreen).** ✅ COMPLETE
  - Implemented: rememberSaveable for scroll index + offset.
  - Scroll position restored when returning from MemoryDetailScreen.
  - Auto-scroll-to-top only triggers on NEW memory additions (not back-nav).

### Deferred to v1.1 (Post-Launch)

- [ ] **Task A6 (DEFERRED): Seekable progress bar.**
  - Add `seekTo(positionMs)` to `AudioPlayer`.
  - Make hero progress bar visually larger (~180dp × 4dp) and add `pointerInput` for tap + drag.
  - Disambiguate tap-to-seek (on bar) from tap-to-play-pause (on hero waveform area).
  - Decide: seek while paused → stay paused or auto-resume?
  - **Why deferred:** diary entries are 30s–2min; scrubbing precision is poor at small bar sizes. Layout changes eat launch effort. Will revisit in v1.1.

---

## Phase: Android Publish (Next Immediate Goal)

### Goal
Get the app live on Google Play Store as a free app. Establish credibility as an independent product builder.

- [x] **Task P1 / Task 60: Indian English Keyword Enrichment** ✅ COMPLETE
  - EmotionDetector.kt enriched with Hinglish, Gen Z slang, spiritual language (commit a708b9a)
  - Keywords: खुशी, शांति, चिंता, slay, vibing, shukar, satsang, etc.
  - All 6 emotions covered (HAPPY, SAD, ANXIOUS, CALM, EXCITED, NEUTRAL)

- [ ] **Task P2: Privacy Policy**
  - Write minimal privacy policy: local-only storage, no tracking, no cloud.
  - Host on GitHub Pages or Notion (free, public URL required by Play Store).
  - Template: "This app stores all data locally on your device. We do not collect, share, or upload any personal data."

- [ ] **Task P3: Play Store Listing**
  - Create Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee).
  - App title: "Memory – Personal Diary"
  - Description: 2–3 paragraphs covering capture (text/photo/audio), emotion detection, local-first privacy.
  - Screenshots: minimum 2 (CaptureScreen, DiaryScreen, DialKnob recommended).
  - App icon: already exists in project.

- [ ] **Task P4: QA on Real Devices**
  - Test full flow: capture (text + photo + audio) → view → edit → delete.
  - Test on Android 12, 13, 14 (3 devices or emulators minimum).
  - Test offline: disable network, verify capture still works.
  - Test with 20+ memories: scroll performance, emotion color accuracy.

- [ ] **Task P5: Build Release APK + Submit**
  - `./gradlew assembleRelease`
  - Sign APK (generate keystore, store safely — never commit to git).
  - Upload to Play Store internal testing track first, then promote to production.
  - Wait 24–48h for review.

---

## Phase: React Native Rewrite (Post Android Launch, ~3 weeks)

### Goal
Single codebase for iOS + Android + Web. Establish cross-platform credibility. Estimated: 3 weeks after Android launch.

- [ ] **Task RN1: Setup & Navigation** — React Native CLI, React Navigation, design tokens from `design.md`
- [ ] **Task RN2: UI Screens** — CaptureScreen, DiaryScreen, IndexScreen, DetailScreen
- [ ] **Task RN3: DialKnob + Waveform** — reimplement custom Canvas components in React Native Skia or SVG
- [ ] **Task RN4: Database** — WatermelonDB or Realm (replaces Room)
- [ ] **Task RN5: Media** — audio recording/playback, camera/gallery (Expo modules)
- [ ] **Task RN6: Emotion Detection** — port Indian English keyword sets from `EmotionDetector.kt`
- [ ] **Task RN7: iOS App Store + Play Store Submission** — both platforms from single codebase

---

## Phase B: Bookmarks + Diary Collections

### Goal
Let users star memories for quick retrieval, and group memories into named collections (like folders).

- [ ] **Task 63: Bookmark — Long-Press Dialog Option.**
  - In `IndexScreen` and `DiaryScreen`, extend the existing long-press dialog (currently Edit / Delete) with a third option: **"Bookmark"** (or **"Remove bookmark"** if already bookmarked).
  - Tapping Bookmark sets `isBookmarked = true` and `bookmarkedAt = System.currentTimeMillis()` via a new `MemoryRepository.setBookmark(id, value)` suspend function.
  - Show a small filled-star icon (`Icons.Default.Star`, emotion colour tint) as an overlay badge on the top-right corner of bookmarked cards in both `BentoMemoryCard` and `IndexMemoryRow`.
  - Bookmarked memories appear first in the "Bookmarked" filter chip view (Task 62), sorted by `bookmarkedAt` descending.

- [ ] **Task 64: Diary Collections — Data Layer.**
  - Create a new Room entity `DiaryCollection` in `data/model/`: fields `id: String` (UUID), `name: String`, `colorHex: String`, `createdAt: Long`.
  - Create a junction entity `MemoryCollectionCrossRef`: `memoryId: String`, `collectionId: String` (composite primary key).
  - Add `DiaryCollectionDao` with: `insertCollection`, `deleteCollection`, `renameCollection`, `getAll(): Flow<List<DiaryCollection>>`, `addMemoryToCollection`, `removeMemoryFromCollection`, `getMemoriesForCollection(collectionId): Flow<List<Memory>>`.
  - Register both entities in `AppDatabase` and bump to version **4** with a migration that creates the two new tables (no changes to existing tables).
  - Add `DiaryCollectionRepository` wrapping the DAO. Wire it up in `AppNavigation` alongside the existing `MemoryRepository`.

- [ ] **Task 65: Diary Collections — UI (Create & Assign).**
  - Add a **"Collections"** entry point: a horizontal scrollable strip of collection pills near the top of `DiaryScreen` (above the memory list, below any date header). Each pill shows the collection name and its assigned colour dot. A `+` pill at the end opens a "New Collection" bottom sheet.
  - **New Collection bottom sheet**: text field for name, a row of 8 preset colour swatches (matching emotion palette). "Create" button saves via `DiaryCollectionRepository`.
  - **Assign from long-press dialog**: add **"Add to collection →"** option that opens a secondary bottom sheet listing existing collections; tapping one calls `addMemoryToCollection`.
  - Tapping a collection pill in `DiaryScreen` navigates to a filtered view (same screen, filter by collection, top bar title = collection name).

---

## Phase C: Delight & Reflection Features

### Goal
Surface meaningful moments proactively: a daily quote, a happy memory reminder, and expressive mood stickers.

- [ ] **Task 66: Daily Quote Bottom Sheet.**
  - On `DiaryScreen` first composition each calendar day, show a `ModalBottomSheet` with an inspirational quote.
  - Quotes: a static curated list of 30 entries embedded in the app (`util/Quotes.kt`), selected by `dayOfYear % quotes.size`.
  - Sheet layout: quote text in `headlineMedium` (Trocchi), attribution in `labelSmall` secondary, a dismiss `TextButton` ("Continue to my diary").
  - **Once-per-day gate**: store the last-shown date in `SharedPreferences` (`diary_prefs` → `last_quote_date`). Only show if today's date differs.
  - Sheet uses `skipPartiallyExpanded = true`; background scrim at `0.4f` alpha.

- [ ] **Task 67: Happy Memory Nudge.**
  - Once per app session (app open → close), if the user has at least one memory with `emotionalTone == "HAPPY"`, show a nudge card as a non-blocking `Snackbar`-style overlay at the top of `DiaryScreen`.
  - Nudge card: a warm rounded pill (`emotionColor("HAPPY").copy(alpha = 0.15f)` background, 12dp corners) showing: ✨ icon + `"Remember this moment?"` + one-line excerpt from a random HAPPY memory. Tapping the card navigates to that memory's `MemoryDetailScreen`.
  - **Once-per-session gate**: track with a `remember { mutableStateOf(false) }` flag at the `AppNavigation` level, passed down via `CompositionLocal` or as a callback.
  - Nudge auto-dismisses after 5 seconds via `LaunchedEffect` + `delay(5000)`.

- [ ] **Task 68: Mood Stickers.**
  - Add a sticker picker to `CaptureScreen`: a small sticker icon button in the capture toolbar row (alongside the mic and photo buttons).
  - Tapping opens a compact horizontal sticker tray (16 stickers: emoji characters covering moods — e.g. ☀️ 🌧️ 🌊 🔥 🌸 🍂 ⭐ 🌙 🎵 📚 🏃 🧘 🤍 💛 🫧 🌿).
  - Selected stickers appear as a small tag row below the text input in `CaptureScreen` and as an overlay badge strip on the memory card in `DiaryScreen` and `IndexScreen`.
  - Stored as a JSON array of emoji strings in the `stickers` column (Task 59). Max 3 stickers per memory.
  - Sticker tray is a `LazyRow` of tappable emoji `Text` composables in a `Box` with a frosted-glass style background (`background.copy(alpha = 0.92f)` + `appleShadow`).

---

## Phase D: Letter to Future Self

### Goal
Let users write sealed diary entries that lock until a chosen future date, then reveal with a special animation.

- [ ] **Task 69: Letter Entry Type — Capture UI.**
  - Add a **"Write a letter to future me"** option to the `DiaryScreen` capture bottom sheet, displayed as a second row below the existing `"What's on your mind?"` zone.
  - Tapping navigates to `CaptureScreen` with `action = "letter"`.
  - In `CaptureScreen`, when `action == "letter"`:
    - Title changes to `"Dear future me,"`.
    - A date picker row appears below the text input: `"Seal until: [date]"` — tapping opens a `DatePickerDialog`; minimum date is tomorrow.
    - On save, sets `entryType = "LETTER"` and `sealedUntil = selectedDateMs` on the `Memory`.
  - Saving a letter is otherwise identical to saving a normal memory (same `CaptureViewModel.saveMemory()` path).

- [ ] **Task 70: Sealed Letter Cards.**
  - In `DiaryScreen` and `IndexScreen`, letters with `sealedUntil > now` display a distinct locked-letter card style:
    - Semi-transparent frosted appearance: card background `secondary.copy(alpha = 0.08f)` with a dashed border (`secondary.copy(alpha = 0.3f)`).
    - Centered lock icon (`Icons.Default.Lock`, 24dp) and label `"Sealed until [date]"` — no text content preview.
    - Tapping a sealed letter shows a `SnackBar`: `"This letter opens on [date]."` — does NOT navigate to detail.
  - Letters where `sealedUntil ≤ now && isRevealed == false` display an **"Open your letter"** banner on the card (warm gradient strip across the bottom, `"Open ✦"`).

- [ ] **Task 71: Letter Reveal Animation.**
  - Tapping an unrevealed ready letter (`sealedUntil ≤ now && isRevealed == false`) navigates to `MemoryDetailScreen` as normal.
  - `MemoryDetailScreen` detects `entryType == "LETTER" && isRevealed == false` and plays a one-shot reveal sequence before showing content:
    - 0–300ms: screen fades in from white.
    - 300–700ms: a `Canvas`-drawn envelope outline (simple path: rectangular body + triangle flap) scales from center, stroke animates from `0f` to full width.
    - 700–1000ms: envelope flap rotates open (`rotationX` 0→-90° on the flap path).
    - 1000ms+: content fades in normally; `isRevealed` is set to `true` via repository call.
  - After the first open, the letter renders identically to a normal `MemoryDetailScreen` with no special intro.

---

## Phase E: Opening Ritual

### Goal
Greet the user with a moment of intention each time they open the app — a brief full-screen overlay that sets a reflective tone before entering the diary.

- [ ] **Task 72: Opening Ritual — Trigger & Container.**
  - Show the ritual overlay once per app session: track with a session-scoped `remember { mutableStateOf(false) }` at `AppNavigation` level; set to `true` after first display.
  - The overlay renders as a full-screen `AnimatedVisibility` `Box` above the `NavHost` content (inside the outer `Scaffold`'s content area), using `fadeIn(tween(400))` enter and `fadeOut(tween(300))` exit.
  - Background: `Brush.radialGradient` from `primary.copy(alpha = 0.12f)` at center to `background` at edges.
  - Auto-dismiss after **4 seconds** via `LaunchedEffect` + `delay(4000)`. User can also tap anywhere to dismiss.
  - After dismiss, the overlay is gone for the rest of the session; `NavHost` becomes fully interactive.

- [ ] **Task 73: Opening Ritual — 4 Greeting Variants.**
  - Randomly pick one of 4 variants each session (`Random.nextInt(4)`, seeded by session start time):
  - **Variant 1 — Morning Affirmation**: a short affirmation sentence from a static list of 10 (e.g. `"Today is yours to shape."`). Renders in `displaySmall` Trocchi, centre-aligned, with a soft warm colour gradient brush (same brand gradient).
  - **Variant 2 — Yesterday's Memory**: shows the most recent memory's first sentence as a quote (`"Yesterday you wrote…"` prefix in `labelMedium`, quote in `headlineMedium`). Falls back to Variant 1 if no memories exist.
  - **Variant 3 — Streak Counter**: counts consecutive days with at least one memory entry. Shows `"🔥 N day streak"` in `displaySmall`. Falls back to Variant 1 if streak < 2.
  - **Variant 4 — Mood Check-in Prompt**: a single question (`"How are you arriving today?"`) with 5 large emoji tap buttons (😌 😊 😔 😤 😴). Tapping an emoji dismisses the overlay and pre-selects that mood in `CaptureScreen` if the user starts a new entry within 60 seconds (passed via a `StateFlow` in a simple session-scoped `ViewModel`).
  - All variants share the same container from Task 72; only the inner content composable changes.
